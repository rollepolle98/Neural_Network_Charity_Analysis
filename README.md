# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Background and Purpose

With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I will use the features in the provided dataset to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, I received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

My goal is to :

* Preprocess Data for a Neural Network Model
* Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
* Optimize the Model
