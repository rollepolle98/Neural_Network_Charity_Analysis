# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Background and Purpose

With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I will use the features in the provided dataset to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, I received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

My goal is to :

* Preprocess Data for a Neural Network Model
* Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
* Optimize the Model



## Results 

* Data Preprocessing
** What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
** What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
** What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
*Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
** How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
** Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
** What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
