# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Background and Purpose

With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I will use the features in the provided dataset to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, I received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

My goal is to :

* Preprocess Data for a Neural Network Model
* Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
* Optimize the Model



## Results 

* Data Preprocessing

  * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  
    * That would be the variable which shows if money was used effecitvely which is : "Is-Succesful" column.
  
  * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  
    * Feautures : EIN,	NAME,	APPLICATION_TYPE,	AFFILIATION	CLASSIFICATION,	USE_CASE,	ORGANIZATION,	INCOME_AMT,	ASK_AMT	IS_SUCCESSFUL
    
  * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  
    * SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND STATUS because both are not significnat values.
  
* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why
  
    * Im not sure about the number of neurons but there are three layers which they are contained within.
    
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  
    * Yes i was able to achieve target model performance
  
  * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
  
    * The biggest change that made the model performance more efficient was converting the NAME column to data points.
